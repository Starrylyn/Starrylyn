# Hanlin Zhao (Zhao Hanlin)

I lead Z.ai AutoTyper (Zhipu AI Input Method) and the GLM-ASR / GLM-ASR-Nano speech model lines.
What I build is specific: voice-first writing that lives inside any input field.
Users speak to draft, edit in-place (rewrite, translation, tone/style), and hand off tasks to agent execution (planning + tool-calling) when needed.
Writeback matters: results return to the same context you're writing, not a separate chat window.

I also invest in robustness and evaluation: real-world speech (dialects, quiet speech, noise, mixed languages) and benchmarks that reflect natural prompts.

GLM-ASR-Nano-2512: 502,953 all-time downloads (as of 2026-02-01).
Earlier at Z.ai: NaturalCodeBench (ACL 2024 Findings). Co-authored: AutoGLM / VisualAgentBench / ChatGLM reports.
