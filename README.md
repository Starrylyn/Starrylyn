:microphone: Voice-first writing workflows in any input field.
:robot: Agent execution when needed - with writeback to the same context.

I lead Z.ai AutoTyper (Zhipu AI Input Method) and the GLM-ASR / GLM-ASR-Nano speech model lines.

## What I build

- Speak to draft, edit in-place (rewrite, translation, tone/style)
- Escalate tasks to agent execution (planning + tool-calling)
- Writeback: results return to where you're typing, not a separate chat window

## Robustness & evaluation

- Real-world speech: dialects, quiet speech, noise, mixed languages
- Benchmarks that reflect natural prompts (NaturalCodeBench, ACL 2024 Findings)
- Co-authored: AutoGLM / VisualAgentBench / ChatGLM reports

## Impact

- GLM-ASR-Nano-2512: 502,953 all-time downloads (as of 2026-02-01)
